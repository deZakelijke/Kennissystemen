US President [Barack Obama](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) has unveiled what he called "the biggest, most
important step we have ever taken" in tackling [climate change](Event, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).
The aim of the revised [Clean Power Plan](Event, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Power_Plan) is to cut greenhouse gas emissions from
US power stations by nearly a third within 15 years.
The measures will place significant emphasis on wind and solar power and other
renewable energy sources.
However, opponents in the energy industry have vowed to fight the plan.
"I'm convinced no challenge provides a greater threat to the future of the
planet," [Mr Obama](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) said. "There is such a thing as being too late."
Those opponents say [Mr Obama](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) has declared "a war on coal". Power plants fired
by coal provide more than a third of the US electricity supply.
The revised plan will aim to cut carbon emissions from the power sector by 32%
by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.
"We are the first generation to feel the impacts of [climate change](Event, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), and the last
generation to be able to do something about it," [Mr Obama](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) said. He likened the
plan to taking 166 million cars off the road in terms of environmental impact.
He called taking a stand against climate change a "moral obligation".
[Mr Obama](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) brushed off the notion that the plan is a "War on Coal" that will kill
jobs and said he is reinvesting in areas of the US known as "coal country".
"Scaremonging" tactics will not work to stop the proposal, he said.
"If we don't do it nobody will. [America](Place, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) leads the way forward... that's what
this plan is about. This is our moment to get something right and get something
right for our kids," he said.
