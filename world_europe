[Angela Merkel](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel) is taking a break. After one of the toughest months of her
chancellorship, [Mrs Merkel](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel) chose to unwind - by watching a five-hour performance
of the [Wagnerian](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner) opera [Tristan and Isolde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Iseult).
The [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) chancellor's summer holiday routine rarely alters.
She is an avid opera fan, so it is usually a trip to the [Bayreuth Wagner festival](Activity, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayreuth_Festival)
followed by a stay in [South Tyrol](Place, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol).
What is different this year is the political storm from which she has emerged in
[Berlin](Place, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) and the speculation still rife in [Germany](Place, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) about her future.
It has been a bruising few months. Largely due to the drama of the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) debt
crisis, whose twists and turns could have come straight from one of the operas
[Mrs Merkel](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel) so enjoys.
There was open rebellion from 60 of her own conservative MPs, who refused to
back a third bailout for [Greece](Place, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece).
But she was also criticised by those who felt, conversely, her stance on [Greece](Place, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece)
had been too harsh.
By refusing to countenance debt relief and allowing her Finance Minister,
[Wolfgang Schaeuble](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Sch√§uble), to threaten [Alexis Tsipras](Person, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Tsipras)'s government with a [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) exit
from the [eurozone](Place, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone), she went too far, they say.
