Angela Merkel is taking a break. After one of the toughest months of her
chancellorship, Mrs Merkel chose to unwind - by watching a five-hour performance
of the Wagnerian opera Tristan and Isolde.
The German chancellor's summer holiday routine rarely alters.
She is an avid opera fan, so it is usually a trip to the Bayreuth Wagner festival
followed by a stay in South Tyrol.
What is different this year is the political storm from which she has emerged in
Berlin and the speculation still rife in Germany about her future.
It has been a bruising few months. Largely due to the drama of the Greek debt
crisis, whose twists and turns could have come straight from one of the operas
Mrs Merkel so enjoys.
There was open rebellion from 60 of her own conservative MPs, who refused to
back a third bailout for Greece.
But she was also criticised by those who felt, conversely, her stance on Greece
had been too harsh.
By refusing to countenance debt relief and allowing her Finance Minister,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, to threaten Alexis Tsipras's government with a Greek exit
from the eurozone, she went too far, they say.
