    "1. (20%) For each string in the `description` column do the following:\n",
    "    1. Determine pre-modifier,  head and  post modifier: store these in new columns\n",
    "2.  (20%) For each head, determine the list of all ancestors of that head in WordNet up to \"person\": store this list in a new column.\n",
    "3. (20%) Use Hearst patterns to extract something like the `description` from the `rdf-schema#comment`\n",
    "    * Add your version as a new column\n",
    "    * Design a comparison of your work with the description column which outputs something like accuracy/precision/recall. You are free, as long as you do it well.\n",
    "4. (20%) Use Hearst patterns plus whatever else you like to extract the nationatility of the person described.\n",
    "    * Include a brief evaluation.\n",
    "2(actually 5). (20%) We are interested in gender aspects. Can you answer these questions:\n",
    "    1. Can we determine the gender from the person from the description and its expansion? \n",
    "        * E.g., we could say it is a female if it was actress, but probably not say it is a male if it was actor\n",
    "    2. There are two columns indicating the gender of the persons. One is made based on the first name, the other on the 3rd person pronouns in the longer description. Both are fairly accurate (more than .9 precision). Can you find a couple of remarkable differences between males and females based on your extracted wordnet concepts?\n",
